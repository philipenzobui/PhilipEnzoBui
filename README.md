### About me

Current Master's student of Mathematics and Statistics student at the University of Montreal in Canada. I previously graduated with a BSc in Actuarial Mathematics and obtained my Associateship of the Society of Actuaries (SOA).

My research applies ideas from probability, bayesian statistics, and statistical learning to solve problems in the intersection of quantitative finance, actuarial science, optimization and machine learning. I am passionate about developing theoretical and computational tools motivated by real life applications.

I have recently taken an interest in the art of solving abstract puzzles, and I believe they are good practice to solving challenging problems wihtout well-defined rules. I mainly work on Jane Street's and IBM research monthly puzzles. If you would like to collaborate, you can reach me by mail or LinkedIn.
