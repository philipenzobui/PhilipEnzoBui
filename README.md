### About me

Current Master's student of Mathematics and Statistics student at the University of Montreal in Canada. I previously graduated with a BSc in Actuarial Mathematics and obtained my Associateship of the Society of Actuaries (SOA).

My research applies ideas from probability, bayesian statistics, and statistical learning to solve problems in the intersection of mathematical finance, optimization and machine learning. I am passionate about developing theoretical and computational tools motivated by real life applications.
