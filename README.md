### About me

Current Master's student in Applied Mathematics and Statistics student at the University of Montreal in Canada. I previously graduated with a BSc in Actuarial Mathematics and obtained my Associateship of the Society of Actuaries (SOA).

My research interests involve ideas from probability, stochastic modelling, and statistical learning to solve problems at the intersection of quantitative finance, actuarial science, optimization and machine learning. I am passionate about developing theoretical and computational tools motivated by real life applications.

Puzzles: I have recently taken an interest in the art of solving abstract puzzles, and I believe they are good practice to solving challenging problems without well-defined rules. I usually complete Jane Street Capital's and IBM's monthly puzzles, but am open to any challenge. If you would like to collaborate, I am available by mail.
