### About me

Current Master's student in Applied Mathematics student at the University of Montreal in Canada.

I am broadly interested in the development of novel methodologies to extract meaningful patterns and information from data. This encompasses ideas from deep learning, time-series forecasting, reinforcement learning, Bayesian machine learning, causal inference, and natural language processing. I am mainly interested in applications to Finance.
